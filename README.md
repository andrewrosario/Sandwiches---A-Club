# Sandwich Club

## What is it? 
The Sandwich Club is a site that allows users to share their favourite sandwiches with the world. Users can create accounts, add their own sandwich recipes to the site, and comment and rate others' sandwiches.

## Creating an account
A link to create one's account is accessible from the home page. Click on the link and enter the requisite information - a username, a display name (which can be your real name, or a name you'd like to be known by), a short bio, an age, an avatar, and a password. Once you've created an account, you will be redirected to your personal home page. In the future when visiting the site's main home page, you can click on the login link to log in.

## Editing your information
Go to your user profile, accessible at /users/{your username}, and click on the edit button to edit your information.

## Creating a sandwich
Head to /sandwiches/new, to which a link is available, to create a new sandwich recipe. First, enter the name of your sandwich, a short description, instructions on how to create a sandwich, and a picture of your sandwich. Click on 'Create sandwich'. On the next page, check the ingredients you'd like, and their quantities. If you'd like to enter a new ingredient that isn't already listed in the checkbox, fill out the new ingredient form first. Once you've entered all your new ingredients and are ready to put out the list of ingredients, click on "Update sandwich" and you will be redirected to your new creation.

## Creating an ingredient
Perhaps you want to just create an ingredient without adding it to a sandwich. The Sandwich Club allows for that too - head to /ingredients/new, and add your new ingredient - its name, its type (whether it's bread, filling, or condiment), a picture, and some additional information for those with dietary restrictions.

## Commenting on a sandwich
Commenting on a sandwich is a cinch as well. Head to the page of the sandwich you want to comment on (you can find it easier with our search form), and comment in the form below the sandwich.
